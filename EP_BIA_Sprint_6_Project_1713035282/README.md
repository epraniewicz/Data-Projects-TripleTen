# BIA Sprint 6: PowerBI
As part of the first foray into Power BI, students are assigned a project using a Shopify App database analysing how app ratings affect popularity of apps using the Shopify platform. The following files are datasets used and screenshots taken during data analysis process.


| Item Number | Item Name | Description |
| :-----------: | ----------- |----------- |
| 1 | [Part 1](https://github.com/epraniewicz/Data-Projects-TripleTen-/blob/750db223fb3baf214b012075886d3c53c7e92592/Sprint_5_Packet_EP_1712281826/Sprint_5_StorytellingREADME.md) | The project task was to analyze sales data for fictitious company Superstore to gain and share any possible insights on customer returns |
| 2 | [Part 2.1](https://github.com/epraniewicz/Data-Projects-TripleTen-/tree/d5b812f2eef3faf77e7bbd3f898a22b5147c5c2f/Sprint%204_Tableau_Project](https://github.com/epraniewicz/Data-Projects-TripleTen/blob/6aa7a18d755433c91e86912983058d0841ffbfa6/EP_BIA_Sprint_6_Project_1713035282/Part%202%20Q%201.png))| Denotes use of DAX to conduct simle calculations of data fields. In this case, DAX is used to calculate the average of all app ratings on the Shopify platform, which is then visualized in a later Power BI report. |
| 3 | [Part 2.2](https://github.com/epraniewicz/Data-Projects-TripleTen/blob/6aa7a18d755433c91e86912983058d0841ffbfa6/EP_BIA_Sprint_6_Project_1713035282/PART%202%20Q%202.png) | This visualization builds on the previous question, and answers whether or not ratings are affected when developers respond to user app reviews. |
| 4 | [Part 3.1](https://github.com/epraniewicz/Data-Projects-TripleTen/blob/6aa7a18d755433c91e86912983058d0841ffbfa6/EP_BIA_Sprint_6_Project_1713035282/PART%203%20Q%201.png) | This visualization depicts rating counts sorted by app developer on Shopify platform, ordered by count from highest to lowest. |
| 5 | [Part 3.2](https://github.com/epraniewicz/Data-Projects-TripleTen/blob/6aa7a18d755433c91e86912983058d0841ffbfa6/EP_BIA_Sprint_6_Project_1713035282/PART%203%20Q%202.png) | This visualization shows the average of reviews marked helpful by users per app developer, ordered from highest average to lowest. |
